Towns and Nations is a Minecraft plugin designed to provide players with an immersive role-playing experience. It enables the creation of towns, management of land claims, establishment of alliances, and the orchestration of wars and betrayals. Towns and Nations is currently in development, primarily for the Arcadia Minecraft server (French server).

Towns and Nations is now on release. Only the town feature has been created for now.
